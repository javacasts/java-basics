Setup
-----

So what do we need to program anything in Java?

 - Java Development Kit
 - Editor / IDE

How to install this depends on the system you are using. You can get the JDK
from [oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Once installed, you should be able to call `java -version` and `javac -version`,
which would print out the version you've installed.

Then you need an editor. Source files are plain text-files, so you could use the
standard notepad in windows, but there are Integrated Development Environments
(IDE) available that help you write your code. Usually you would choose from
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), and
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but you also can use
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/),
[emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vim](http://vim.org/) or any
other editor that can edit text-files.
